# Header {#header1}
Some text.
An inline equation is $y=mx+b$.

**bold** _italic_ ~~strikethrough~~ `monospace` fonts.

Superscript^1^ subscript~1~ with spaces~1\ 2~

> block quotation
> follows here

```python
print("this is a code block in python!")
x += 6
```

Items in a list:
- one item
- another one

Can also enumerate:
1. first
2. second

(i) first
(ii) second

List of definitions:

Term 1
 : definition

Term 2
 : another definition

Use a _horizontal rule_ to divide sections:

****

Next section has a table:

Col A    Col B    Col C
-----    ----     --
1        2        3
4        five     6ix
-        -        -

Let me reference to [the first header](#header1).
Also reference something easy like [google](www.google.com).

Quickly make a footnote for extratext[^note1]

[^note1]: contains some extra info for you!
